# Org owner privileges

## Overview

Multiple faculty and staff members have org owner privileges in the UC Berkeley School of Information GitHub organization.  In order to ensure that there is sufficient visibility into when and for what purpose org owner privileges are exercised, all org owners should comply with the following policies.

## Exercising org owner privileges

1.  Faculty with org owner privileges should exercise them as needed to manage repos for their classes.  Examples include:
  * Setting up a GitHub classroom
  * Managing teams: adding or removing a team from their repo's access list, or changing the level of access a team has on their repo. 
2.  Any change to org level settings other than the ones listed above should be done by the IT team, please send us a help request. Examples of changes managed by the IT include:
  * Any change to org level settings
  * Sending invitations to join the org.
3.  Any proposed change to org level settings should be announced far enough in advance to allow faculty and the IT team to discuss the impact of the change.
4.  Policies for managing the UC Berkeley School of Information GitHub will evolve as our needs and GitHub's services change.  Any proposed change to the policies for managing this GitHub org should be announced far enough in advance to allow faculty and the IT team to discuss the impact of the change.
