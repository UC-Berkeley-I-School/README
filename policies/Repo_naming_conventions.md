# Repo naming conventions

## Overview

The UC Berkeley School of Information GitHub org hosts a wide variety of repos. Provided they conform to the accaeptable use policy, repos may be:

* created by faculty, staff or students
* long-lived or short-lived
* used for group work or indiidual work

As the number of repos in this GitHub org increases, a clear and universally applied naming convention is critical to ensure that the org remains usable.

## Repo name elements

The following rules should be applied from left to right when naming a repo:

1. Program name: All repo names should begin with the name of their associated degree program:  MICS, MIDS or MIMS
2. Course number: All repo names should include the number of their associated course: w241, 241, etc.  Please note that course numbers are sometimes shared across MICS, MIDS and MIMS programs, so course number alone is not unique
3. Description: A description is required for any repo used for student work.  Descriptions can be any of the following:
    * your full name
    * your School of Information user ID
    * your group name: If this repo supports a service hosted on https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu, please use the group name as the decription
    * your project name: If this repo supports a project, such as a Capstone class final project, please use your project name as the description
4. Term: Term is required for any repo used for student work.  Valid term names include both the session and yearfor the 2020 -2021 academic year are:
    * Fall20 or Fall2020
    * Winter21 or Winter2021
    * Summer21 or Summer2021

## Example repo names

The following are all valid examples of repo names created by faculty to support instruction:

* MIDS-1D-Computing-Basics
* mids-w200-Course-Syllabus 
* mids-w241

The following are valid names for student repos:

* mids-w200-JohnDoe-Spring21
* mids-w210-MyCapstoneProject-winter2021


## Policy Enforcement

The School of Information IT team reserves the right to rename repos to bring them into compliance with this policy. We will notify repo owners when we take action, provided we can clearly identify the repo owner.
