# Team naming conventions

## Overview

The UC Berkeley School of Information GitHub org has a large number of members and repo collaborators. In order to facilitate providing appropriate access and to associate individuals with their role in the School, repo access is generally provided by assiging people to GitHub teams.  GitHub teams may be:

* created by faculty or staff
* long-lived or short-lived

Students who would like a team created to support their group's work should ask their instructor or the School's IT team to create one.

As the number of members in this GitHub org increases, a clear and universally applied naming convention is critical to ensure that the org remains usable.

## Team name elements

The following rules should be applied from left to right when naming a team:

1. Program name: All team names should begin with the name of their associated degree program:  MICS, MIDS or MIMS
2. Course number: All team names should include the number of their associated course: w241, 241, etc.  Please note that course numbers are sometimes shared across MICS, MIDS and MIMS programs, so course number alone is not unique
3. Description: A description is required for any team used for student work.  Descriptions can be any of the following:
    * your group name: If this team supports a service hosted on https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu, please use the group name as the decription
    * your project name: If this team supports a project, such as a Capstone class final project, please use your project name as the description
4. Term: Term is required for any team used for student work.  Valid term names include both the session and year.  Examples of valid terms for the 2020 -2021 academic year are:
    * Fall20 or Fall2020
    * Winter21 or Winter2021
    * Summer21 or Summer2021

## Example team names

The following are all valid examples of team names created by faculty to support instruction:

* mids_w200_instructors
* mids_w200_students_spring21

## Policy Enforcement

The School of Information IT team reserves the right to rename teams to bring them into compliance with this policy. We will notify team owners when we take action, provided we can clearly identify the team owner.
