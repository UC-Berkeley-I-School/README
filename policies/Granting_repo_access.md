# Granting repo access

## Overview

As membership in the UC Berkeley School of Information GitHub org grows, a clear and universally applied convention for granting repo access is required to ensure that the org remains manageable.

## Repo access lifecyle

It is appropriate for faculty, staff and students to have access to this GitHub org at various stages in their affiliation with the School, including:

* accepted, but not yet enrolled in or teaching classes
* actively teaching or enrolled in classes
* on leave
* alumna or emerita

However, an individual's access may change depending on their affiliation with the School.  For example, a student might be:

* invited to join the GitHub org after acceptance into a degree program
* granted read access to repos before a term starts to read course materials
* granted write access to repos during the term
* reduced in privileges after a course ends or their degree program is completed

## Granting repo access via org membership

Wherever possible, individuals will be invited to join the GitHub org as members and access will be granted through membership in one or more teams.  The use of teams is encouraged in order to:

* identify an individual's affiliation with the School
* identify their usage of specific repos
* ensure that repo access is granted consistently

##  Granting repo access via repo collaborators

Granting repo access by inviting people as repo collaborators is discouraged.  Repo collaborators can not be assigned to teams, so there is no data avilable about the collaborator's affiliation with the School, or whether or not their current level of access is correct.

## Automating repo access

The School of Information IT team can automatically create and assign students to GitHub teams based on enrollment data provided by the University.  Faculty members who rely on GitHub repos to support instruction are encouraged to contact the IT team about this service.
